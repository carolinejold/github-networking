# GitHub Networking

Project has been deployed and can be viewed here: https://github-networking.netlify.app/

## Task & Solution

* "Build a web service or app that utilises data provided by the Github API"

### What the solution does:
* This app provides users with the opportunity to easily search GitHub developers based upon their location and the programming language in which they code.*
* The aim of this is to encourage networking within the local community, to build support networks for software developers and to help people learning to code to find mentors nearby.
* The app is completely mobile responsive and I have kept to clear naming conventions.
* I am currently using React Hooks, but to make the app even more scalable I could convert it to use Context or Redux.

### To run the application:
* Clone the repository
* Install dependencies (npm i)
* Start the server (npm start)
* You will be automatically redirected to your default browser and will be able to view the app
